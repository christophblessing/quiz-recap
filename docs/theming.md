# Theming

## Colors

The App comes with a standard color scheme.

However, you can theme the App e.g. to fit a corporate design.
To do so, CSS variables defined in `src/index.css` must be overridden.

There are four colors, each must have a base and a lighter shade.

- `primary` for action buttons such as submitting an answer
- `neutral` for backgrounds
- `success` for indicating correct answers and starting a new quiz
- `danger` for destructive actions and indicating a wrong answer
